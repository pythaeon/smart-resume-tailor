    header: Start With Why
    content: >
      I believe clarity is the most powerful tool in a leader’s arsenal.

      I’ve spent my career building systems that cut through noise—whether that means
      aligning teams, untangling legacy infrastructure, or designing processes that
      scale. I don’t just want to ship; I want to understand what we’re building,
      why it matters, and how to make it repeatable.

      My north star? Better systems, better thinking, better outcomes—for teams *and*
      the people in them.

  who_i_am:
    header: Who I Am
    content: >
      I’m a systems-first builder with a background that spans infrastructure, cloud,
      software, and strategy. For nearly two decades, I’ve worked across startups
      and Fortune 500s—leading programs that untangle legacy systems, introduce modern
      tools, and scale processes with intention.

      I’m the person teams call when the mission is complex, the path is unclear,
      and the cost of getting it wrong is high. Whether I’m solving for architecture,
      operations, or human dynamics—I zoom out, ask better questions, and get the
      right work moving.
    mutability: moderate

    header: How I Work
    intro: >
      I build systems that work -- at scale, across teams, and under pressure.  That
      means knowing the tools *and* the terrain.

        for a scrappy Managed Services group, only to step into full departmental leadership after the abrupt
